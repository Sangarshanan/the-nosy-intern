> Readings in Database Systems (commonly known as the "Red Book") has offered readers an opinionated take on both classic and cutting-edge research in the field of data management since 1988. Here, we present the Fifth Edition of the Red Book â€” the first in over ten years.

Written by the legendary Peter Bailis, Joseph M. Hellerstein, and Michael Stonebraker.
The goal with this is to get a whirlwind tour of database systems research.
