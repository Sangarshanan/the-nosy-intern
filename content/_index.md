**Do you miss the rush of being an intern?**  
**Do you miss feeding your curiosity and building cool shit for the sake of it?**

We do too!   
We are a community of hackers with similar interests with the goal of learning, building, and breaking things together and having fun while doing it.

This is a space for you to start and participate in various activities like study groups, projects, etc.
This community will be a good fit if you are:
* **A Craftsperson**: You care about the craft(eg: programming, audio engineering).
* **Self-Directed**: You are driven by intrinsic motivation.
* **Multi-Dimensional**: You have multiple interests that may sometimes be disjoint.
